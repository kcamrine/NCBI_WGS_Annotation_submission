### Alrighty, here is my step-by-step and explanation for what I did to
### do a WGS annotated genome submission for NCBI

## Step 1 is to create a bioproject submission per genome. Specify that
## you will be submitting WGS, Annotated, SRA, etc. 

## Next create a biosample submission with details on your sample

## Next start the WGS submission process

## WHAT YOU WILL NEED

# -a working version of the FAST tools installed in your path
# -fasta file with scaffolds with concise names
# -gff version 2 file (with the scripts I provide here)
# -

## WHAT I GIVE YOU

# -a crappy script to do the first conversion of the gff file to the tbl
# file required for the tbl2asn script that will ultimately make your 
# asn submission file
# -another crappy script to substitute in the names necessary


# step 1: remove internal stops
fasgrep -s "-" <protein-fasta-file>.fasta > <protein-fasta-file>-internalstop.fasta
