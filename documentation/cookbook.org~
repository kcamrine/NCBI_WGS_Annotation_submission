 Alrighty, here is my step-by-step and explanation for what I did to
 do a WGS annotated genome submission for NCBI

* Step 1 is to notify NCBI you will be submitting data

** create a bioproject submission per genome. Specify that
 you will be submitting WGS, Annotated, SRA, etc. 

** Next create a biosample submission with details on your sample

** Next start the WGS submission process

** WHAT YOU WILL NEED

*** fasta file with scaffolds with concise names
*** gff version 2 file (with the scripts I provide here)


## WHAT I GIVE YOU

# -a crappy script to do the first conversion of the gff file to the tbl
# file required for the tbl2asn script that will ultimately make your 
# asn submission file
# -another crappy script to substitute in the names necessary
